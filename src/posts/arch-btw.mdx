## Introduction

<hr />

Ever since I started programming, I have been using Windows. I did not even think about any other operating systems at that time. And to this day I still use it for playing games. I felt really comfortable using Windows.

<br />

I also like to customize everything I use and I found myself customizing windows with a lot of third-party tools like **Rainmeter**, and several other for customizing it's taskbar and desktop. I even installed a tiling window manager on it called [**FancyWM**](https://github.com/FancyWM/fancywm).

## When the window broke

<hr />

After Windows 11 was released, I disliked a lot of its changes and it broke a lot of customization tools that I used. The OS was filled with a lot of bugs thanks to all the bloat I installed just to change a few pixels on my screen.

<br />

After I got better at programming, I realized that a lot of the packages are really hard to get working on Windows and easily work on Linux. Also, I gained a lot of interest in tiling window managers and really wanted to use one.

<br />

Not only that, some tools are only available on Linux and I found myself using WSL a lot and had times I would spend my entire day using only WSL.

## Making the switch

<hr />

It was time to switch, hence I began hunting for distros to see which one would fit my style. I realized whichever distro I was gonna pick I was gonna heavily customize it.

<br />

So... I decided to go with Arch Linux as it has almost nothing installed at first and I can install only the things that I like and waste less time removing default apps and changing default configs.

<br />

I spent that night dual-booting Windows 11 and Arch Linux and felt really happy about all the new things I will get to learn and experience. Not only that, I had now gained the ability to say the phrase **"i use arch btw."**

## Using and customizing

<hr />

After booting and starring at the terminal for around 20 seconds I realized that I needed a **Window Manager**. So I installed `i3` as I heard a lot about it during my Windows time.

<br />

After installing `i3`, I tried to reduce the brightness of my laptop using the brightness key and failed successfully. I realized I have almost nothing installed and need to get basic functionality setup to make the system usable. 

<br />

Even though I needed to setup everything, I felt a lot of joy customizing and ricing my OS. Also I learned a lot of things in the process.

## Final Thoughts

<hr />

I wanted to share my experience with Linux because I was really scared and hesitant to switch away from Windows but once I did I felt amazing. Linux has improved my productivity a lot. If you are a developer I highly recommend you to try out Linux.
