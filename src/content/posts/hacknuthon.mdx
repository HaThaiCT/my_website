## The Beginning

I'm thrilled to share our incredible journey at HackNUthon 5.0, where our team "Formality" achieved something remarkable. Among 800+ participants and approximately 200 teams, we secured not just the 2nd place in the EdTech track by Crest Data Systems, but also clinched the 2nd position overall!

## The Team

Our success was a result of perfect collaboration between four passionate developers:
- Darshil Thakkar
- Palash Jhaveri
- Yuvrajsinh Gohil
- Myself (Nirlep Gohil)

## The Project: Brilliant++

In just 36 intense hours, we built Brilliant++, an innovative AI-powered education platform. The name was inspired by our vision to enhance the traditional learning experience and make it more interactive and engaging.

### Key Features
- **Course Creation**: A robust system for creating and managing educational content
- **Video Integration**: Seamless video content integration for better learning
- **AI-Powered Transcripts**: Automatic generation of course video transcripts
- **Smart Quizzes**: AI-generated quizzes based on course content
- **Gamification**: Interactive leaderboard to encourage healthy competition

### Tech Stack
- Next.js with TypeScript for the frontend
- tRPC for type-safe API calls
- PostgreSQL with Prisma for database management
- Google's Gemini AI for content generation
- Cloudinary for media management
- Docker for containerization

## The Experience

The 36-hour hackathon was an incredible mix of coding sprints, quick decisions, and lots of coffee. We faced several challenges:
- Integrating multiple AI services seamlessly
- Ensuring real-time updates for the leaderboard
- Optimizing video processing for better performance
- Managing state across multiple features

But with each team member bringing their unique strengths to the table, we managed to overcome these hurdles one by one.

## The Recognition

Being recognized among such talented participants was truly humbling. The judges were particularly impressed by:
- The completeness of our solution
- The seamless integration of AI
- The potential impact on education
- The technical implementation

## Looking Forward

This experience has only fueled our passion for building impactful solutions. The positive feedback from judges and other participants has given us ideas for further improvements and potential real-world applications.
