## The Remake

I've been using [Astro](https://astro.build) for a while now, and I've been really enjoying it. It's a great way to build websites, and I've used it for a few projects. However, I have been wanting to add a lot of new features to this website and make it much more than just a blog.

And with the new updates in [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/), it seemed like the perfect time to switch. So here we are.

## What's new?

I've been working on this new site for a week now, I have finished the basic layout and recreated what I had before in the [Astro version](https://nirlep.netlify.app/).

The new tab that you may have noticed is... **Adventures**. It is going to be the place where I post about my adventures with technology, programming and life in general. I have a lot of ideas for this section, and I'm really excited to work on it.

The source code for this website is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/Nirlep5252/website). Feel free to check it out and give me some feedback.

## Thank you

I want to thank you for reading this post, and I hope you like the new website. I'm really excited to work on it and make it better.
