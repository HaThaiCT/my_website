## Explanation

<hr />

This problem is similar to the previous one, except we cannot simply loop and alternate the numbers. Here, we'll have to use a complex data structure to keep track of the children and their positions. We'll use an `indexed_set` from the `pb_ds` library. This data structure is similar to a `set`, but it also allows us to access the `i`th element in the set in `O(log n)` time. This is exactly what we need to solve this problem.

<br />

Behind the scenes, this data structure is implemented as a [Red Black Tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red%E2%80%93black_tree). This is a self-balancing binary search tree. This means that the tree will always be balanced, and the height of the tree will always be `O(log n)`. This is important because it means that all operations on the tree will be `O(log n)`.

<br />

Unfortunately, I wasn't able to implement it in Python and Rust. I am still learning these data structures and once I learn more, I will update this post with the Python and Rust implementations.
