## Problem Explanation

<hr />

Here, we are given a number `n` and we need to apply the following operations on it:

- **number is odd?** : multiply by 3 and add 1
- **number is even?** : divide by 2

And we need to apply those until the number `n` becomes `1`. <br />

This can be solved by a simple while loop and implementing the operations. <br /> <br />

## Code

<hr />

**Python**
```python
n = int(input())

while n > 1:
  print(n, end=" ")
  n = (n * 3 + 1) if n % 2 else (n // 2)

print(1)
```

<br />

**C++**
```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main () {
  long long n;
  cin >> n;

  while (n > 1) {
    cout << n << " ";
    n = (n % 2) ? (n * 3 + 1) : (n / 2);
  }

  cout << 1 << endl;

  return 0;
}
```
